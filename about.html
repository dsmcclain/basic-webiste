        <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting!</h1>
        <p>My name is Dylan, and I built this website to document my work as a software developer.  It has been a tremendous tool for increasing my learning, but my hope is that it will spark curiosity for you as well.</p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I am a former therapist and educator who navigated to software development after a long and productive detour into the world of coffee.  My years of effort building and nurturing systems of teamwork – first as a member of an interdisciplinary medical team and then as the designer and manager of a training program for a 40-person coffee company – concluded when I accepted that my work in the service industry was not paying the bills.  So in early 2018 I began teaching myself software development.  I have worked predominantly with JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, and the React and Vue frameworks.  I am happy to call myself a Junior Engineer, but I believe a team is a network where every node contributes meaningfully, regardless of their incomplete knowledge of the whole.  To me, that’s more accurate than calling people ‘Junior’, ‘Mid-level’, or ‘Senior.’ </p>
        <h3>Ice Breaker</h3>
        <p>I have maintained a persistent passion for hiking on Mt. Hood, gardening (currently growing roses, hops, and lettuces), and eating.  I just love to eat.  If we ever meet and you aren’t sure what to say, bring up these topics and we will have a lot to talk about!</p>
