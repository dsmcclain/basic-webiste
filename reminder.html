      <p class="article-subtitle">THE STORY</p>

      <p>
        <span style="color: orangered">The problem was</span> I started having tremors in my head and neck.  Turns out I have a condition called Cervical Dystonia, and my new lifestyle of sitting for hours at a computer under intense focus was...not good. I needed a recurring reminder to stand up, walk around the block, or just take a break for 5 minutes. And it needed to be something that was hard to dismiss.
      </p>
      <img class="article-internal-image" src="images/reminder2.jpg">
      <p>
        My solution was to bring my cat to work.  Or rather, to build a cron job that showed me a photo of my cat every so often, to remind me to give my body a break. I had never set up a cron job on my computer, but it's not hard. If you aren't familiar, <span class="codespan">cron</span> is a utility available on most systems, and it allows you to run jobs at set intervals. In this context, a 'job' can be almost anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most linux distributions have the <span class="codespan">crontab</span> command, which makes setting a cron job even easier. Running <span class="codespan">crontab -e</span> opens a document in your default editor, and you just add your cron syntax and the command, script, or path to a script that you want to run as a job.  For me, this looks like: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="color: orangered">The most interesting piece of the design puzzle was</span> something something something else. Probably a few more sentences here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Future-facing paragraph: maybe there is more that could be done to extend this program?  Or what did I learn from it?  Or perhaps what could be done better if we were to build it again?  Or even some resources to further explore.
