      <p class="article-subtitle">THE STORY</p>

      <p>
        Sometime last spring I could feel myself graduating.  Not in the concrete definition of the word, like with a cap-and-gown, but in the sense of <em>moving to the next level</em>. I was graduating beyond the role of “junior” developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        How could I tell? For starters, I was getting bigger and bigger projects at work – projects that were measured in weeks and months instead of hours and days. These were projects that required me to do a lot more research, create a roadmap, and set up meetings between different teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also started noticing that I was being asked for input on a lot of different issues. I was asked to weigh in on the decision of whether or not to incorporate tracking software on our site. I was asked what I thought about new features for our product, regardless of whether I would be working on them. I was expected to have an <em>opinion</em> beyond just making changes to the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was graduating. And let me be clear – this whole distinction between “junior” and “mid-level” is completely artificial. Things are not so black and white. There are definitely still days where I feel green, green, green. But I noticed I was working in a wider orbit. And I wanted to build something that reflected this graduation. Something that stretched my comfort zone but also showcased my evolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I built neon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neon is my revival of a cherised game from my high-school years, a flash game called “Moebius Challenge.” It was an addictive puzzle game where you had to rotate tiles to create loops while under time pressure. I couldn’t find any code or documentation for the original game, or a securely-hosted version of it. All I could find was that the original author was someone named Xiao Fred<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. But I longed to play Moebius again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder if I could build it, I thought. I wonder if I could make it look…<em>even cooler</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="color: #b60d00">The most interesting piece of the design puzzle</span> was calculating when a loop is created. You have a 9x9 board with ‘corner’ and ‘straight’ tiles, and every time the user clicks on a tile it rotates. The program needs to know when the tiles are arranged to make a closed loop. This is tricky because each tile is pointing in two directions, and a single click changes the whole board.
      </p>
      <img class="article-internal-image" src="images/neon-loop.png" alt="a loop of neon lights"/>
      <p>
        The solution was recursion. When a tile is clicked, create a "path" by checking the tile’s neighbor to see if the two tiles link up. If they do, follow the neighboring tile to <em>its</em> neighbor and see if those two link. The base case is achieved when you reach out to the neighbor and find a link, only to realize that the neighbor is the very first tile in the path. That’s a loop! If at any point you reach out to a tile’s neighbor and there is no link, the recursive function ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m sure I could have figured out this recursive function a year ago, as a “junior”. But being a developer is about much more than algorithms. For example, Neon was never meant for a mobile device, so what if somebody visited the site on their phone? Did I want them to just see a broken website? That’s not very professional. So I built a mobile welcome-screen to handle the situation:
      </p>
      <img class="article-internal-image" src="images/neon-mobile-welcome.png" alt="a screenshot of a handsome web page reading please visit with a larger screen"/>
      <p>
        What if somebody visited and didn’t understand the game? I needed an instructions page. What about when somebody paused the game? I needed a pause screen. What about if somebody clicked on the instructions while the game is going? Do I want to have the game keep running in the background or should it automatically pause? As I mature as a developer I realize that graduating beyond "junior" work is as much about getting better at asking these <em>what ifs</em> as it is about getting better at writing software. <span style="color:#b60d00">Thanks for reading!</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span style="color: #777">Epilogue</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        People have asked me about the overall look of the game, and how I got that neon “effect” to work. I could write an entire article about creating the glass tubes of neon. The short answer is that I drew them on the computer. I used Inkscape, an open source graphic editing platform, and just watched a bunch of tutorials. And there is no animation happening. When a loop is formed, the image of the inert tube of glass gets replaced by an identical piece of “lit” glass. It’s the old switcheroo. Like most things I create, if I can find a solution using the most basic tools available, then that’s what I will do. (I mean, did you read my article about <a href="./little-programs.html">this very website?</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        It took longer than I wanted to create some realistic-looking neon tubes that connected perfectly to one another and ‘lit up’ when looped, and I’m sure a skilled designer could have done better, but I’m happy with how it turned out.
